# README

Sample [Sencha Animator](http://www.sencha.com/products/animator) project that goes with our blogpost at sencha.com. The project is a quiz mini-app optimized for the iPhone (fullscreen), although it should run fine in any modern webkit browser. Android support is limited if any.

## Contents

*finishedQuiz* - This is what your project should look like after finishing the blogpost.
